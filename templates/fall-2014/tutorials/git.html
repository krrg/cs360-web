# Tutorial: Git

Learning to use version control is absolutely essential for a
programmer.  If you are not using some kind of version control system
already, then you should immediately start using one. Version control
ensures that you can always retrieve an older version of your code in
case you need to retrieve some code you have deleted. Storing your
repositories in the cloud ensures that you won't lose your code, which
should be one of your most precious possessions. I find this so
convenient, I use version control not just for code but also for
LaTeX papers and presentations I write, and for other documents I keep in my
home directory. 

If you have not already learned how to use git, then I strongly
suggest learning now. Git is the preferred tool for many developers
because it handles [distributed version
control](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)
so well. Outside of university projects, it is most common to work on
teams when writing code, so a tool like Git that provides easy
collaboration is required. It is quickly becoming a de facto standard
so it is useful to understand at least its basics. Git is supported by
most online software repositories, like [GitHub](https://github.com/)
and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/).

To get started, I recommend doing some initialization for your name,
email, and editor:

<pre>
git config --global user.name "Daniel Zappala"
git config --global user.email daniel.zappala@gmail.com
git config --global core.editor emacs
</pre>

## Learning Git

The best place to learn Git is to use the free [Pro Git
book](http://git-scm.com/book). Read Chapters 1 and 2 and you will
learn what you need to be productive for individual projects in this
class. 

The commands I use most often:

** Create Repositories **

* `git init` : initialize a new repository
* `git clone <url>` : clone a repository

** Work With A Local Repository **

* `git log` : view all previous commits
* `git log -p` : view all previous commits with the diffs
* `git status` : list changed and new files
* `git diff` : view changes to files
* `git add .` : add all new files to a repository
* `git commit -a` : commit all changes to all files
* `git tag <name>` : mark current commit with a tag

** Update a Repository and Publish Changes **

* `git remote add <remote> <url>`: add a remote repository
* `git pull <remote> <branch>` : download commits from a remote repository and merge them
* `git push <remote> <branch>` : upload commits to a remote repository
* `git push --tags` : push tags to a remote repository

In addition to these commands, it is useful to create a `.gitignore` file
containing file extensions you would like to ignore. For example, this
might include:

<pre>
*.pyc
*~
</pre>

This ignores all compiled Python files and any emacs backups.

# Branching and Workflow

Once you start participating in shared projects, then Chapters 3 and 5
of Pro Git will help you with branching and workflow models. I also
recommend [this example
workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/),
which you can trim down for smaller projects. There are some good
[thoughts about
workflows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow)
by Atlassian.

The commands I use most often:

* `git branch` : list all branches
* `git checkout <branch>` : check out an existing branch
* `git checkout -b ` : create and check out a new branch

Here is a useful [Git cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).
