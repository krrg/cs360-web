# Lab: Messaging Service

The goals of this lab are (1) to learn how to write a client-server
application using the BSD socket API, (2) to understand how to process
and parse data when reading from a network socket, and (3) to
understand how to implement a protocol.

In this assignment, you will create a server that can store and
retrieve messages for people.  You will also create a client that
users can use to send and read messages.

Your code must be written in C++.

## Messaging Protocol

The messaging protocol defines the communication between the client
and the server.  Message fields are separated by whitespace and lines
are ended by the newline character (\n).

### Storing Messages

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
put [name] [subject] [length]\n[message]

<b>Responses</b>
OK\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

Store a message for a user identified by [name].  The message consists
of a [subject] and [length] characters.  The entire message comes
after the newline character.  The server returns the *OK*
response if the message is stored successfully.  Otherwise, the server
returns the *error* response, including a descriptive message
explaining the error.

Messages are stored in memory and are not written to disk. This means
that multiple clients can connect over time and read all messages
stored on the server, but once the server quits all messages are lost.

### Listing Messages

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
list [name]\n

<b>Responses</b>
list [number]\n[index] [subject]\n...[index] [subject]\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

Get a list of messages for a user identified by [name].  The server
returns the *list* response if the query is formatted properly.  The
[number] returned may be zero if no messages are stored for that user.
The subsequent lines list a numeric [index] and the associated
[subject] for each message stored for the user.  Otherwise, the server
returns the *error* response, including a descriptive message
explaining the error. The [index] should count starting at 1 and
should be unique for each user.

### Retrieving Messages

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
get [name] [index]\n

<b>Responses</b>
message [subject] [length]\n[message]
error [description]\n
</pre>

Get a message given by [index] for a user identified by [name].  The
server returns the *message* response if the query is formatted
properly and a message with the given index exists for the listed
user.  The message consists of a [subject] and [length] characters.
The entire message comes after the newline character.  Otherwise, the
server returns the *error* response, including a descriptive
message explaining the error.

### Reset

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
reset\n

<b>Responses</b>
OK\n
</pre>

Remove all stored messages for all users. This is used for
testing purposes.

## Server

The messaging server implements the server side of the messaging
protocol and handles one client at a time.  It is
singly-threaded. Once connected, a client should be able to issue as
many commands as it wants, and the server will only close the
connection if the client closes it first. You are welcome to use the
echo server distributed on the class web site as a starting point.

## Client User Interface

The messaging client performs two functions: it implements the client
side of the messaging protocol and it provides a user
interface. <u>The user interface is not identical to the messaging
protocol.</u> The user interface defines what the user sees, which
hides some of the detail of the underlying protocol.

The messaging client provides a user interface and implements the
client side of the messaging protocol.  The user interface should
provide a prompt of the form "% " (percent sign and a space) and
should support the following commands:

<pre>
% send [user] [subject]
- Type your message. End with a blank line -
[message]
...
[message]
[blank line]
% 
</pre>

This sends a message to the server for the identified [user] with the
given [subject] and [message].  The client should only print a
response from the server if it returns an error.

<pre>
% list [user]
[index] [subject]
...
[index] [subject]
% 
</pre>

This sends a request to the server to list all the messages for
[user].  The client should print the list of indexes and subjects, or
an error message. The [index] should start counting at 1 and should be
unique for each user.

<pre>
% read [user] [index]
[subject]
[message]
% 
</pre>

This sends a request to the server to read the message at [index] for
the indentified [user].  The client should print the subject and the
message, or an error message.

<pre>
% quit
</pre>

This should quit the program.

## Command Line Arguments

The messaging server should be called <i>msgd</i> and take the
following arguments:

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>


The port number is required; it indicates the port your server will
bind on.  You may code a default value for this option so that you do
not have to type it every time when you test your code.

The messaging client should be called <i>msg</i> and take the
following arguments:

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-s [server]        machine name of the messaging server (e.g. hiking.cs.byu.edu)
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>

The user must specify the server and port options so that the client
can connect to the instant messaging server.  You may code a default
value for these options so that you do not have to type them every
time when you test your code.

For both the client and server, the user may also specify a debugging
flag.  In this case, you should print out any helpful debugging
information you want, but you should never print debugging lines if
the flag is not specified on the command line.

You should use the *getopt* API for parsing the command line options;
see *man 3 getopt*.  This is a powerful parser that is easy to use and
enables many of the standard command-line behaviors that are familiar
to Linux users.

## Example Code

There are some [socket programming examples in
C++](https://github.com/zappala/socket-programming-examples-c) on
GitHub.

## Submission

Put all of your code into a single directory. Be sure to create a tar
file of your code, not a zip file. Be sure the tar file creates the
directory when it is untarred, and doesn't put all of the files in the
current directory. Follow the instructions below.

* Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
send only the source code and your Makefile.  For example, if your
code is in the directory called lab1, then you would type this:

    <pre>
    cd lab1
    make realclean
    cd ..
    tar -czvf lab1.tgz lab1
    </pre>

*Submit the tgz file using
[learningsuite.byu.edu](http://learningsuite.byu.edu)

## Grading

Your lab will be tested as specified in the [grading
sheet]({{url_for("show",directory="winter-2014/labs",page="messaging-service-grading")}})
      

As a part of testing, we will use the [Python testing
script](https://github.com/zappala/messaging-service-python) posted at
Github.

If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print out
clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
should apply this same standard to how you document your code.
