# Lab: Download Accelerator

In this assignment, you will create an HTTP downloader that can
download a file in parallel using a number of concurrent number of
threads. You will use Python for this assignment.

The goals of this assignment are (1) to gain additional familiarity
with using Python for writing networking code, (2) to learn how to use
threading in Python, and (3) to understand the tradeoffs of
parallelism in network programming.

## Downloader

The downloader uses the following command line syntax:

    downloadAccelerator.py [-n threads] url

On starting, the downloader first sends a HEAD request to the web
server specified in the URL, to determine the size of the object. If
the object has a valid Content-Length field, it then downloads the
object in parallel, using the specified number of threads. Each thread
sends a GET request with a Range header that gives the range of bytes
desired. The response should have a Content-Range header indicating
the byte range of the response.

The downloader saves the file in the current directory, using the same
name as given in the URL. If the URL ends with "/", then the name
"index.html" is implied.

The downloader also reports, to standard output, the following:

    [URL] [threads] [bytes] [seconds]

where [URL] is the URL given on the command line, [bytes] is the
number of total bytes in the object, and [seconds] is a floating point
number indicating the time taken to download the object, starting from
when the threads are created and ending when the last thread
finishes.

## Experiments

Several scripts for experiments are located in the 
[Python	Networking and Threading GitHub repository](https://github.com/zappala/python-networking-and-threading).
Use the	[experiments.py](https://github.com/zappala/python-networking-and-threading/blob/master/download-accelerator/experiments.py)
script to run a set of experiments using your downloader on large
files of sizes that are approximately 1 MB, 10 MB, and 100 MB. This
script will vary the number of threads from 1 to 10 and repeat each
experiment 10 times. Run the experiments both while on campus and
while off campus.  If the 100MB file takes too long while off campus,
you can skipt that part of the experiment.

With the data you collect, use the
[plot.py](https://github.com/zappala/python-networking-and-threading/blob/master/download-accelerator/plot.py)
script to graph the results. This script will create a series of box
plots showing the median and the distribution of the download time
versus the number of threads, for each file.</p>

## Python Setup

To run these scripts on your machine, you can install the Python
dependencies into your system:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install requests
    sudo pip install numpy
    sudo pip install scipy
    sudo pip install matplotlib

Alternatively, you can install them in a virtual
environment. This method also works to run these scripts on
the CS machines. First install dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install virtualenv

Or on the CS Linux machines:

    easy_install pip
    easy_install virtualenv

Then create a virtual environment:

    mkdir ~/virtualenvs
    virtualenv ~/virtualenvs/cs360
    source ~/virtualenvs/cs360/bin/activate

You now are in a Python virtual environment, and you will be able
to install packages in your home directory:

    pip install requests
    pip install numpy
    pip install scipy
    pip install matplotlib

To deactivate the virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Report

Write a report that explains your methodology (how you ran the
experiments and collected data), shows your graphs, and discusses what
they show. Be sure to refer to the graphs in your report, for example
"Figure 1 shows that ...". Explain whether there are benefits to
downloading in parallel and discuss any tradeoffs.

## Submission

Create a tgz of your program directory. Be sure to include a PDF
of your report. For example, if your code is in the directory called
download-accelerator, then you would type this:

    tar -czvf download-accelerator.tgz download-accelerator

Submit your report and the tgz file using [learningsuite.byu.edu](http://learningsuite.byu.edu).

## Grading

Your lab will be tested as specified in the
[grading sheet]({{url_for("show",directory="fall-2013/labs",page="download-accelerator-grading")}}).
If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print out
clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag (-d)
is given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your
debugging information is, the better your chances for getting useful
help. You should apply this same standard to how you document your
code.
