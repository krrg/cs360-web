# Syllabus

This course covers Internet application programming, including
client-server and web applications. At the end of this course,
students should be able to:

* Use the BSD socket API to develop network applications.

* Understand and use concurrent programming to develop a thread-safe
  server, including both thread pool and event-driven architectures.

* Use experiments to conduct an in-depth performance evaluation of
  network software to better understand design tradeoffs and operating
  system overhead.

* Use a common web application framework to build a web database
  application, with both relational and no-SQL databases.

* Understand security issues for network software and be able to write
  code that is secure against common attacks.

* Have the confidence and ability to quickly learn a new language and
  libraries.

## Textbooks

You do not need to buy a textbook for this class. Instead, you should
be able to learn everything from lecture notes and online
materials.

In case you are interested in books, here are some sources I use for
the material in this class:

### General Networking

* [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet](http://kuroseross.com/)

    This textbook covers the entire network stack from application
    layer down to the link layer.  If you want to have a textbook that
    explains how the Internet works, this is the one to buy.  We will
    only use a small part of this book in this class, but you may want
    to buy this book if you intend to take CS 460 since it is required
    for that class.

* [Web Protocols and Practice: HTTP/1.1, Networking Protocols, Caching, and Traffic Measurement](http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0201710889&rl=1)

    This is a good book on HTTP and web caching, but has too narrow a
    focus to serve as a general textbook for the class.  I will get
    some of my lecture material on the Internet, HTTP, web proxies,
    web server architectures, and web workload characterization from
    this book.

### Socket Programming

* [Unix Network Programming, Volume 1: The Sockets Network API, 3rd Edition](http://www.awprofessional.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=0131411551&rl=1)

    This has been the definitive reference for network programming for
    more than a decade, and has been recently updated.  I will provide
    all of the necessary information in the lectures, but if you want
    a reference on socket programming, this is a great book to buy and
    one you will use for many years if you do socket programming.  In
    addition to sockets, this book covers threads, concurrent
    architectures, and many network programming details.

### C/C++ Programming

We will use C++ for some labs, so it will be helpful to have a good
reference.  I strongly recommend getting one of these if you don't
already have one.

* [C++ in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/C-Nutshell-Ray-Lischner/dp/059600298X/ref=pd_sim_b_3)

* [Practical C++ Programming, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Second-Steve-Oualline/dp/0596004192)

* [Practical C Programming, 3rd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-3rd-Steve-Oualline/dp/1565923065)

### Python

We will use Python for some labs, for processing and graphing data,
and possibly for web application programming.  I list some free online
references below, plus a book in case you want one.

* [Safari Books Online](http://search.lib.byu.edu/byu/link?type=service-databases-itemlink&url=http://dbs.lib.byu.edu/safari-tech-books) : O'Reilly books, available for free both on and
off campus.

* [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)

* [Code Like a Pythonista: Idiomatic Python](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html)

* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Think Python](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/)

* [Python in a Nutshell](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Nutshell-Second-OReilly/dp/0596100469/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1293845142&sr=1-7)

* [Learn Python Interactive Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Nutshell-Second-OReilly/dp/0596100469/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1293845142&sr=1-7)

* [Codecademy Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/python)

I also suggest that you become familiar with the official [Python documentation](http://www.python.org/doc/).

## Computing Environment

We will be using a Linux environment for this class. You can use the
Linux labs, setup your laptop to boot into Linux, or setup a virtual
machine running Linux. We will be using Python 2.7, along with various
packages such as matplotlib and LaTeX.  You are strongly encouraged to
become familiar with Linux, its software, and the command-line
environment. Being fluent in multiple computing environments is an
important part of a CS education.

You may, if you are talented and persistent, figure out how to setup a
Mac OS machine with the required software. Based on past experience,
you will likely have less luck doing this with a Windows
machine. Either way, your code will be expected to run on a Linux
machine when you submit it.

Regardless of the computing environment you use, you should become
familiar with [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) and
[GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Assignments and Grading Policy

The assignments for this class will consist of labs and exams.  Labs
must be written in the assigned language and must compile and run on
the department's Linux machines.

Labs will be graded by the TA or instructor.  For some labs, the
scoring will be based on running your code.  In these cases, we will
publish a grading sheet before each assignment is due, listing the
tests we will run and how many points each test is worth.  For other
labs, the scoring will be based on a report you write.  For these
labs, the assignment will indicate how the report will be scored.

Grading for exams will be on a scale of 0 to 10 for each problem, with
a final score based on the total possible points.  A score of 10
indicates your answer is completely correct (A), and a score of 5
indicates your answer is entirely wrong but you made a reasonable
effort (E).  Grades in between indicate very good (9), good (8),
adequate (7), and poor (6). Failure to make a reasonable effort to
answer a question scores a 0.

Your final grade will be computed by weighting all scores as follows:

> Labs 70%

> Exams 30%

## Late Policy

Labs are due on the day indicated. To accommodate difficulties in your
schedule, you can turn in work late, but you will be penalized 10% for
being late by up to one week. If an assignment will be more than a
week late, you need to see the instructor to make arrangements in
advance, with a 20% penalty typically being applied.

You may avoid late penalties due to a medical excuse by making an
arrangement in advance with the instructor. Exceptions can also be
made for a learning disability.

## Collaboration Policy

Most assignments for this class **must** be done individually. You
are encouraged to discuss solving the labs and any programming
problems you encounter generally, but you must write your own code and
should not view any other student's code.  When producing written
work, your writing must be your own thoughts.  Your use of sources
(ideas, quotations, paraphrases) must be properly acknowledged and
documented.

Group work is permitted only where specified clearly in the
assignment.  Group work is meant to be done jointly with a team of two
to five students.  Students in a group should work on problems and
programs together, and each student should perform a roughly equal
amount of work.

## Educational Policies

### Honor Code Standards

In keeping with the principles of the [BYU Honor
Code](http://honorcode.byu.edu/), students are expected to be honest
in all of their academic work.  Academic honesty means, most
fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be
your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle
may result in a failing grade in the course and additional
disciplinary action by the university.

### Policy on Harassment

Harassment of any kind is inappropriate at BYU. Specifically, BYU's
policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the
university but to students as well. If you encounter sexual
harassment, gender-based discrimination, or other inappropriate
behavior, please talk to your professor, contact the Equal Employment
Office at 422-5895 or 367-5689, or contact the Honor Code Office at
422-2847.

### Students with Disabilities

BYU is committed to providing reasonable accommodation to qualified
persons with disabilities. If you have any disability that may
adversely affect your success in this course, please contact the
University Accessibility Center at 422-2767. Services deemed
appropriate will be coordinated with the student and instructor by
that office.
