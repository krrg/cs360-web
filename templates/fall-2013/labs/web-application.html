# Lab: Web Application

In this assignment, you will write a web database application.  The
goals of this assignment are to (1) learn how to design a model for a
database appliction, and (2) gain experience designing a user
interface for a web application, and (3) learn how to program a web
application using a modern framework.

## Requirements

Your application must meet these general requirements:

* Meets a need you have identified or that benefits society in some way. Examples include:

    * family history
    * open government
    * a startup or business idea

* Has a back end that stores data in a relational (e.g. MySQL) or
document database (e.g. MongoDB).

* Has a front end that follows good [web design
principles](http://cs360.byu.edu/static/fall-2013/lectures/web-design.pdf).

* Supports a REST interface as an API that can be used for third-party
applications.

* Uses some kind of cutting-edge framework, or a framework you havenâ€™t
used before. Good choices are:

    * Javascript: node.js and Express for the backend, Ember or
    Angular for the front end

    * Python: Flask or DJango (in increasing level of complexity)

    * Ruby: Sinatra, Padrino, Rails (in increasing level of complexity)

    * PHP: Yii

    You might consider using Flask since you know some Python already. I
    would also encourage you to try node/Ember/Angular, since these are
    rapidly becoming very popular and many jobs are available for them.

* Has the code stored in GitHub using the open source license of your
choice Host the final project on a web site. 

* The final project and each part of the assignment is hosted on a
web site. Each of the reports listed below should be hosted on
a GitHub Wiki, GitHub Pages, or similar site.

## Idea, Features, and Architecture.

Describe the idea for your application. This can be the same text in
your proposal. This should include:

* Your pitch. Explain what need this application meets. Why will anyone 
want to use it?

* A brief description of what your application will do to meet this need.

Describe the features of your application. This should include:

* All of the features you would ideally implement if you had the time
to create your ideal application.

* The list of features you will implement this semester. This could be
a minimal viable product, if you were going to market. Larger teams
should have more features.

Describe the architecture of your application. This includes the
technologies you will use for a database, a back-end server, and a
front end.  You may design a mobile application instead of or in
addition to a web site.

Submit the URL of your web site where this report is located.

## Interface Design

Draw the user interface for your program.  This includes every page on
the site. You can separately draw headers and footers if they are
consistent on every page.  Your drawings may be done with a computer
program or by hand, but should be of a quality you would be comfortable
showing to your supervisor at work.

Put these drawings onto a web page for your site. Explain how the user
will navigate through these pages.

Submit the URL of your web site where the design is located.

## Milestones

For each milestone, write a short report of your current
progress. Explain what you have accomplished so far and what
features are implemented. Host this report on the same web site.

Submit the URL of your web site where the milestones are located.

## Final Report

When you are finished with your application, write a report following
this outline:

* **Description**: Explain the purpose of the site and what
functionality you implemented.

* **Database Schema**: Describe how data is stored in your database.
If you used a relational database, show your entity-relationship
diagram that includes all entities, attributes, and relationships, and
explain what it contains.  You should use the standard
entity-relationship format as shown in class. Use a program to draw
this diagram, such as [lucidchart](http://www.lucidchart.com) or
[dia](http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia). If you used a document
databse, show your JSON document structure and explain what it
contains.

* **Contributions**: Describe in detail the contributions made by each
member of the project. Each member is responsible for contributing a
few paragraphs in this section.

* **Future Work**: Describe a roadmap for future development, with
additional features you could add or changes to the interface.

Submit the URL of your web site where the report is hosted.

## Final Submission

When finished with your final project, submit the URL where your
application is hosted, along with any login information needed for an
administrative user, and any other information needed for evaluating
the application

On this site, be sure there is a URL for your GitHub code and a URL for
the Wiki or other pages where the additional reports are hosted.

## Grading

This assignment is worth 250 points, using the following scale:

* Idea, Features, and Architecture: 10 points. Judged based on
completeness.

* Interface Design: 20 points. Initial design of the application. Judged
on usability.

* Milestone #1: 20 points. Judged based on progress and effort.

* Milestone #2: 20 points. Judged based on progress and effort.

* Report: 30 points. Judged based on the clarity and quality of your
report.

* Utility of the application: 100 points. Judged based on the features
completed, how useful this site would be to your target audience. The
size of your group will be taken into consideration.

* Design of the application: 50 points. Judged based on the overall
design, how well it follows web design principles and practice. We
will evaluate your front page experience in addition to the
application itself.
