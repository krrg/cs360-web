<h1>Lab: Web Server</h1>

<p>The goals of this assignment are (1) to understand how to create a
  scalable server architecture and (2) to understand and use fundamental
  POSIX system calls for the file system and time.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will write a web server in C++ that
  implements some of the HTTP 1.1 specification given in RFC 2616.  You
  will implement enough of HTTP to demonstrate that you can write a
  substantial server application and understand fundamental POSIX system
  calls.  In addition, you will use a scalable event-driven server
  architecture.</p>

<h2>Event-Driven Server Architecture</h2>

<p>An event-driven web server uses the <i>epoll</i> interface to
  manage a set of sockets in a single thread.  The epoll_wait() call
  returns a list of sockets that have I/O events ready and the server
  handles them one at a time.  There is

  <a href="/fall-2012/code">sample code</a>

  in the Server Architecture section showing you how to do this.</p>

<p>You have two options for this architecture:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The server configures each client to use non-blocking socket I/O,
    and continues to call recv() on the client until it returns an error
    code indicating that no data is available.</li>


  <li>The server performs only one recv() per socket that is ready, to
    avoid blocking while waiting for more input.</li>

</ul>

<p>In both cases, the server maintains a separate message cache for each
  socket. In addition, the server times out any sockets that have been
  idle for a sufficient period of time.</p>

<h2>Server Functionality</h2>

<p>Your web server should handle multiple client requests on a single
  socket, subject to a timeout. You need to keep the connection open
  until the client closes it or it times out due to inactivity.  As you
  handle a client, you will process a request, return a response, and
  then loop to handle another request.  If the socket is ever idle for
  too long, then you should stop processing requests from the client and
  close the connection.</p>

<p>Refer to the lecture notes and

  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</a>

  for details on how to implement HTTP 1.1.  You can use a web browser
  or the <i>nc</i> program to test your server.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Your server should implement the GET method.  Because it
  uses HTTP 1.1, your server should support multiple requests on one
  TCP connection and multiple hosts on one web server.</p>

<p>If the URI given is "/" your server should default to serving
  "/index.html".</p>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>You should implement the following headers:</p>

<ul>

  <li>General Headers
    <ul>
      <li>Date</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Response Headers
    <ul>
      <li>Server</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Entity Headers
    <ul>
      <li>Content-Type</li>
      <li>Content-Length</li>
      <li>Last-Modified</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Both the Date and Last-Modified headers should use RFC 822 / RFC
  1123 format dates.</p>

<p>Your server can determine the Content-Type of a file using its
  extension, based on the configuration file discussed below.<p>

<p>Note that your server should be able to parse any headers not
  listed and ignore them.</p>

<h3>Response Codes</h3>

<p>You should implement the following response codes and use them as
  appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>200 OK</li>

  <li>400 Bad Request : if the web server parses the request and the
    method or URI is empty, or if the request contains a host that this
    server doesn't handle</li>

  <li>403 Forbidden: if the web server does not have permission to open
    the requested file</li>

  <li>404 Not Found: if the web server cannot find the requested
    file</li>

  <li>500 Internal Server Error: if the web server encounters any other
    error when trying to open a file</li>

  <li>501 Not Implemented: if the web server does not implement the requested
    method</li>

</ul>

<h3>Extra Credit</h3>

<p>For extra credit, you can make your web server work with the Lab #2
  downloader. This requires supporting HEAD requests and Range requests.</p>

<h2>Web Server Configuration</h2>

<p>Your web server should be configured by reading in a file called
  <i>web.conf</i>.  This file will determine where resources are located
  and what types of files the server supports.  The configuration file
  can contain multiple lines, with each line following one of the
  following formats:</p>

<pre>
host [name] [path]
media [ext] [type]
parameter [name] [value]
</pre>

<p>An example configuration file could contain:</p>

<pre>
host carmelo.cs.byu.edu /tmp/web1
host localhost /tmp/web2

media txt text/plain
media html text/html
media jpg image/jpeg
media gif image/gif
media png image/png
media pdf application/pdf

parameter timeout 1
</pre>

<p>A host line tells the server where the document root is located for a
  given host.  This path can be either relative "web1" or absolute
  "/tmp/web1".  A relative path starts in the current directory, whereas
  an absolute path starts in the root directory.</p>

<p>A media line tells the server the MIME type to use in the Content-Type
  header for a document that ends in the given extension.  If a document
  has no extension, or if its extension is not listed in the
  configuration file, then your server should treat it as a text/plain
  file.</p>

<p>The parameter line tells the server the time, in seconds, that a
  socket is allowed to be idle before it will be closed.</p>

<p>When you start your web server, you should parse this configuration
  file.</p>


<h2>Supplied Code</h2>

<p>Use the HTTP parser and the configuration file parser on the

  <a href="/fall-2012/code">code page</a>

  of the class web site.

</p>

<h2>Command Line Arguments and Error Checking</h2>

<p>Your server should be called <i>web</i> and must take the following
  arguments:</p>

<pre>
-p [port]
-d
</pre>

<p>The port argument gives the port the web server should bind to, by
  default 8080.  The debug flag turns debugging on for your server.  For
  example:</p>

<p>You should check for errors for all system calls and exit
  gracefully if an error occurs, printing out an appropriate error
  message with <i>perror()</i>.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Download this <a href="/static/fall-2012/lb4-testing.tgz">set
    of files</a> for basic testing of your web server. Be sure to
  change the permissions of the file test.txt so you get a 403
  code when accessing it:</p>

<pre>
chmod ugo-rwx lab4-testing/test.txt
</pre>

<p>Use this <a href="/static/fall-2012/stress-test.py">stress
    test</a> Python script to test how your web server responds to
  different levels of load. For example:</p>

<pre>
python stress-test.py localhost:8000/largefile.txt -t 10 -d 10
</pre>

<p>will keep 10 threads active for 10 seconds.</p>

<h2>Report</h2>

<p>When you turn in your program, include a paragraph that gives a
  short guide to your code, sufficient for the TA to do a code review
  and verify that you have implemented the architecture
  properly. Describe how you handle I/O, timeouts and
  caching. Be sure to mention where the code is located in your
  files.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<ol>

  <li>Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
    send only the source code and your Makefile.  For example, if your
    code is in the directory called lab3, then you would type this:

<pre>
cd lab4
make realclean
cd ..
tar -czvf lab4.tgz lab4
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>Submit your report and the tgz file using
    <a href="http://learningsuite.byu.edu">learningsuite.byu.edu</a>.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Your web server will be tested as specified in the
  <a href="/fall-2012/labs/web-server-grading">grading sheet</a>.
</p>

<p>If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print
  out clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
  given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
  information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
  should apply this same standard to how you document your code.</p>
