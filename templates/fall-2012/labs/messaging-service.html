<h1>Lab: Messaging Service</h1>

<p>The goals of this lab are (1) to learn how to write a
  client-server application using the BSD socket API, (2) to
  understand how to process and parse data when reading from a
  network socket, and (3) to understand how to implement a
  protocol.</p>

<p>In this assignment, you will create a server that can store and
  retrieve messages for people.  You will also create a client that
  users can use to send and read messages.</p>

<h2>Messaging Protocol</h2>

<p>The messaging protocol defines the communication between the client
  and the server.  Message fields are separated by whitespace and lines
  are ended by the newline character (\n).</p>

<h3>Storing Messages</h3>

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
put [name] [subject] [length]\n[message]

<b>Responses</b>
OK\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

<p>Store a message for a user identified by [name].  The message
  consists of a [subject] and [length] characters.  The entire message
  comes after the newline character.  The server returns the <i>OK</i>
  response if the message is stored successfully.  Otherwise, the server
  returns the <i>error</i> response, including a descriptive message
  explaining the error.</p>

<h3>Listing Messages</h3>

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
list [name]\n

<b>Responses</b>
list [number]\n[index] [subject]\n...[index] [subject]\n
error [description]\n
</pre>

<p>Get a list of messages for a user identified by [name].  The server
  returns the <i>list</i>response if the query is formatted
  properly.  The [number] returned may be zero if no messages are stored
  for that user.  The subsequent lines list a numeric [index] and the
  associated [subject] for each message stored for the user.  Otherwise,
  the server returns the <i>error</i> response, including a descriptive
  message explaining the error. The [index] should count starting at 1 and
  should be unique for each user.</p>

<h3>Retrieving Messages</h3>

<pre>
<b>Message</b>
get [name] [index]\n

<b>Responses</b>
message [subject] [length]\n[message]
error [description]\n
</pre>

<p>Get a message given by [index] for a user identified by [name].
  The server returns the <i>message</i> response if the query is
  formatted properly and a message with the given index exists for the
  listed user.  The message consists of a [subject] and [length]
  characters.  The entire message comes after the newline character.
  Otherwise, the server returns the <i>error</i> response, including a
  descriptive message explaining the error.</p>

<h2>Messaging Server</h2>

<p>The messaging server implements the server side of the messaging
  protocol and handles one client at a time.  Once connected, a client
  should be able to issue as many commands as it wants, and the server
  will only close the connection if the client closes it first. You are
  welcome to use the echo server distributed on the class web site as a
  starting point.</p>

<h2>Messaging Client</h2>

<p>The messaging client provides a user interface and implements the
  client side of the messaging protocol.  The user interface should provide
  a prompt of the form "% " (percent sign and a space) and should support
  the following commands:

<pre>
% send [user] [subject]
- Type your message. End with a blank line -
[message]
...
[message]
[blank line]
% 
</pre>

<p>This sends a message to the server for the identified [user] with
  the given [subject] and [message].  The client should only print a
  response from the server if it returns an error.</p>

<pre>
% list [user]
[index] [subject]
...
[index] [subject]
% 
</pre>

<p>This sends a request to the server to list all the messages for
  [user].  The client should print the list of indexes and subjects, or
  an error message. The [index] should start counting at 1 and should be
  unique for each user.</p>

<pre>
% read [user] [index]
[subject]
[message]
% 
</pre>

<p>This sends a request to the server to read the message at [index] for
  the indentified [user].  The client should print the subject and the
  message, or an error message.</p>

<pre>
% quit
</pre>

<p>This should quit the program.</p>

<h2>Command Line Arguments</h2>

<p>The messaging server should be called <i>msgd</i> and take the
  following arguments:</p>

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>


<p>The port number is required; it indicates the port your server will
  bind on.  You may code a default value for this option so that you do
  not have to type it every time when you test your code.</p>

<p>The messaging client should be called <i>msg</i> and take the
  following arguments:</p>

<pre>
Argument           Definition
---------------------------------------------------------
-s [server]        machine name of the messaging server (e.g. hiking.cs.byu.edu)
-p [port]          port number of the messaging server
-d                 print debugging information
</pre>

<p>The user must specify the server and port options so that the
  client can connect to the instant messaging server.  You may code a
  default value for these options so that you do not have to type them
  every time when you test your code.</p>

<p>For both the client and server, the user may also specify a
  debugging flag.  In this case, you should print out any helpful
  debugging information you want, but you should never print debugging
  lines if the flag is not specified on the command line.</p>

<p>You should use the <i>getopt</i> API for parsing the command line
  options; see <i>man 3 getopt</i>.  This is a powerful parser that is
  easy to use and enables many of the standard command-line behaviors
  that are familiar to Linux users.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<ol>

  <li>Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
    send only the source code and your Makefile.  For example, if your
    code is in the directory called lab1, then you would type this:

<pre>
cd lab1
make realclean
cd ..
tar -czvf lab1.tgz lab1
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>Submit the tgz file using
    <a href="http://learningsuite.byu.edu">learningsuite.byu.edu</a>.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Your lab will be tested as specified in the

  <a href="/fall-2012/labs/messaging-service-grading">grading sheet</a>.
</p>

<p>If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print
  out clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
  given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
  information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
  should apply this same standard to how you document your code.</p>
