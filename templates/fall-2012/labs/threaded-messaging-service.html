      <p>The goals of this assignment are (1) to learn how to use the
	pthreads library to manage threads, (2) to understand how to create
	a multi-threaded server, (3) to understand how and where to use basic
	thread synchronization, and (4) to gain practice with client software
	that can issue multiple requests over a socket.</p>

      <p>In this assignment, you will convert your singly-threaded messaging
	server from

	<a href="/fall-2012/lab1.html">Lab 1</a>

	into a multithreaded server.</p>

      <h2>Messaging Server</h2>

      <p>Modify your server so that it creates a thread pool with 10
	threads.  When a new client arrives, the server should add it to a
	queue of connections.  The threads in the pool should remove one
	connection from the queue, handle all of its requests until the client
	closes the socket, and then go back to the queue. If the queue does
	not have a connection available, the thread should sleep until a
	connection is ready. You should use semaphores to make this work.
      </p>

      <p>Because the server is multi-threaded, you will need to ensure that
	your code uses shared memory synchronization to protect access to the
	queue and to other data structures you are using to keep track of
	messages that have been stored on the server.  You can use a mutex or
	a semaphore to do this.</p>

      <h2>Messaging Client</h2>

      <p>You should not need to modify your client for this lab.</p>

      <h2>Report</h2>

      <p>When you turn in your program, include a short report, in text or
	PDF format, listing the data structures where you used synchronization
	and the location of these data structures in your code.  This should
	be enough information for the TA to find the relevant sections of your
	code and verify that you have used memory synchronization.</p>

      <h2>Submission</h2>

      <ol>

	<li>Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
	  send only the source code and your Makefile.  For example, if your
	  code is in the directory called lab2, then you would type this:

<pre>
cd lab2
make realclean
cd ..
tar -czvf lab2.tgz lab2
</pre>

	</li>

	<li>Submit your report and the tgz file using
	  <a href="http://learningsuite.byu.edu">learningsuite.byu.edu</a>.
	</li>

      </ol>

      <h2>Grading</h2>

      <p>Your lab will be tested as specified in the
	<a href="/fall-2012/labs/threaded-messaging-service-grading">grading sheet</a>.
      </p>

      <p>If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print
	out clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag is
	given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your debugging
	information is, the better your chances for getting useful help. You
	should apply this same standard to how you document your code.</p>
