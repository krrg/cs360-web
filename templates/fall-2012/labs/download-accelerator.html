<h1>Lab: Download Accelerator</h1>

<p>In this assignment, you will create an HTTP downloader that
  can download a file in parallel using a number of concurrent
  number of threads.</p>

<p>The goals of this assignment are (1) to gain additional familiarity
  with the BSD socket API, (2) to learn how to use the pthreads library
  to manage threads, and (3) to understand the tradeoffs of parallelism
  in network programming.</p>

<h2>Downloader</h2>

<p>The downloader uses the following command line syntax:</p>

<pre>
download [-n threads] url
</pre>

<p>On starting, the downloader first sends a HEAD request to the web
  server specified in the URL, to determine the size of the object. If
  the object has a valid Content-Length field, it then downloads the
  object in parallel, using the specified number of threads. Each thread
  sends a GET request with a Range header that gives the range of bytes
  desired. The response should have a Content-Range header indicating
  the byte range of the response.</p>

<p>The downloader saves the file in the current directory, using the
  same name as given in the URL. If the URL ends with "/", then the name
  "index.html" is implied.</p>

<p>The downloader also reports, to standard output, the following:</p>

<pre>
[URL] [threads] [bytes] [seconds]
</pre>

<p>where [URL] is the URL given on the command line, [bytes] is the
  number of total bytes in the object, and [seconds] is a floating point
  number indicating the time taken to download the object, starting from
  when the threads are created and ending when the last thread
  finishes.</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>

<p>Use this

  <a href="/static/fall-2012/experiments.py">Python script</a>

  to run a set of experiments using your downloader on large files of
  sizes that are approximately 1 MB, 10 MB, and 100 MB. This script will
  vary the number of threads from 1 to 10 and repeat each experiment 10
  times. Run the experiments both while on campus and while off campus.
  If the 100MB file takes too long while off campus, you can skipt that
  part of the experiment.</p>

<p>With the data you collect, use this

  <a href="/static/fall-2012/plot.py">Python script</a>

  to graph the results. This script will create a series of box plots
  showing the median and the distribution of the download time versus
  the number of threads, for each file.</p>

<p>Note, to run these scripts on the CS machines, add the following to
  your .bashrc and .bash_profile files:</p>

<pre>
export PYTHONPATH=.:$HOME/lib
</pre>

<p>Log out and log back in and then run:</p>

<pre>
easy_install scipy
easy_install matplotlib
</pre>

<p>If this fails, you may need to use:</p>

<pre>
easy_install --install-dir ~/lib scipy
easy_install --install-dir ~/lib matplotlib
</pre>

<p>On your own machine:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get install python-scipy
sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
</pre>

<p>Write a report that explains your methodology (how you ran the
  experiments and collected data), shows your graphs, and discusses what
  they show. Be sure to refer to the graphs in your report, for example
  "Figure 1 shows that ...". Explain whether there are benefits to
  downloading in parallel and discuss any tradeoffs.</p>

<h2>Submission</h2>

<ol>

  <li>Create a tgz of your program directory.  Remove any binaries and
    send only the source code and your Makefile.  Be sure to include a PDF
    of your report. For example, if your code is in the directory called
    lab2, then you would type this:

<pre>
cd lab2
make realclean
cd ..
tar -czvf lab2.tgz lab2
</pre>

  </li>

  <li>Submit the tgz file using
    <a href="http://learningsuite.byu.edu">learningsuite.byu.edu</a>.
  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Your lab will be tested as specified in the
  <a href="/fall-2012/labs/download-accelerator-grading">grading sheet</a>.
</p>

<p>If you wish to receive help with your code, then you should print
  out clear and concise debugging information when the debugging flag
  (-d) is given on the command line. The more helpful and clear your
  debugging information is, the better your chances for getting useful
  help. You should apply this same standard to how you document your
  code.</p>
