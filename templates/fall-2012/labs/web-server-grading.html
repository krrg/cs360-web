<h1>Web Server Grading Sheet</h1>

      <p><i>The TA will fill out this sheet when grading your program.</i></p>

      <div class="border">
	Student Name:
      </div>

      <p><b>TA:</b> <i>Check the boxes below to indicate which tests pass
	  successfully.  Circle the boxes that do not work correctly and
	  include a written statement explaining the error that occured.</i></p>

      <h2>Basic Functionality</h2>
      
      {{ item("HTML File and Embedded Images",20,"Use a web browser to
      access the server and view the index.html file provided with the
      assignment. The server should provide both the index file and
      the embedded images. This should work for a URI that is either /
      or /index.html.") }}

      {{ item ("Large File",10,"Use a web browser to access the server
      and download largefile.txt. The server should provide the entire
      file.") }}

      {{ item("PDF File",10,"Use a web browser to download
      I-Have-A-Dream.pdf. The file should open properly in a PDF
      reader.") }}

      {{ item("Persistent Connection",10,"Use telnet to verify that
      the server uses a persistent TCP connection, allowing the client
      to fetch multiple objects during one connection. The server
      should also timeout an idle connection based on the timeout
      period given in the configuration file.") }}

      {{ item("Headers",10,"Check that the server always returns a
      Date header with the correct date format and a Server header
      identifying the name of the server. Check that the server
      includes a valid Content-Length, Content-Type, and Last-Modified
      header.") }}

      {{ item("Root Directories",10,"Check that the server uses the
      proper root directories, based on the web server
      configuration. It must be able to use a relative path.") }}

      <h2>Error Checking and Response Codes</h2>

      {{ item("Server handles bind errors",2,"Start two servers with
      the same port number and check whether a bind error is handled
      gracefully.") }}

      {{ item("400 Bad Request",2,"Start two servers with the same
      port number and check whether a bind error is handled
      gracefully.") }}

      {{ item("403 Forbidden",2,"Place a file in the server's document
      root that has no read permissions for anyone. Check that the
      server returns a 403 error when the client requests this file.")
      }}
      
      {{ item("404 Not Found",2,"Check that the server returns a 404
      error when the client asks for a file that does not exist.") }}

      {{ item("501",2,"Check that the server returns a 501 error when
      the client uses a method that does not exist.") }}

      <h2>Architecture</h2>

      {{ item("Code Review",20,"The TA will examine your code and
      compare it to your report to determine whether you have properly
      implemented the event-driven architecture.") }}

      {{ item("Load Test, Low Rate",25,"The TA will use the Python
      testing script to create a steady stream of requests at a low
      rate (10 threads busy for 10 seconds). Your server should handle
      this load well.") }}

      {{ item("Load Test, Moderate Rate",25,"Repeat the previous test
      using a stream of requests at a moderate rate (100 threads busy
      for 10 seconds). Your server should handle this load well.") }}

      <h2>Extra Credit</h2>

      {{ item("HEAD and Range Requests",15,"Make your web server work
      with your Lab #2 downloader. This involves support HEAD requests
      and Range requests.") }}
